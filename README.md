# Question 1 :Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in C++. Dijkstra's algorithm is a widely used algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

## Contents
- `src/`: Contains the C++ source code for the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started
To use the Dijkstra's algorithm implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
3. Compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

   ```bash
   g++ dijkstra.cpp -o dijkstra
   ```

4. Run the executable with the input graph file as a command-line argument:

   ```bash
   ./dijkstra input_graph.txt
   ```

   Replace `input_graph.txt` with the path to your input graph file. The input graph file should be in a specific format (e.g., adjacency list or adjacency matrix) as expected by the program.

## Sample Input Graph Format
The input graph file should contain the graph representation in a specific format. For example, if using an adjacency list representation, each line in the file may represent a node followed by its adjacent nodes and corresponding edge weights.

Example input graph file format:
```
1 2:10 3:5
2 4:3
3 2:2 4:9
4 5:2
5
```

This represents a graph with nodes 1 to 5 and their adjacent nodes with corresponding edge weights.

## Implementation Details
- The program reads the input graph from a file and constructs a graph data structure.
- It applies Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a specified source node to all other nodes in the graph.
- The implementation may include optimizations or variations of Dijkstra's algorithm, depending on specific requirements or constraints.

## Additional Notes
- This implementation provides a basic version of Dijkstra's algorithm. Depending on the application, you may need to customize or extend it to handle specific edge cases or requirements.
- Ensure that the input graph file follows the expected format for proper execution of the program.

# Question 2: Finding Journeys in a Bus Network

## Overview
This repository contains a solution for finding journeys in a bus network based on General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data. The program takes two command-line inputs: the source stop ID and the destination stop ID, and prints all possible direct journeys and journeys with one transfer between the specified stops.

## Contents
- `src/`: Contains the C++ source code for the solution.
- `data/`: Contains sample GTFS data files used for testing.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started
To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src/` directory.
3. Compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o bus_journey_finder
   ```

4. Run the executable with the source and destination stop IDs as command-line arguments:

   ```bash
   ./bus_journey_finder source_stop_id destination_stop_id
   ```

   Replace `source_stop_id` and `destination_stop_id` with the actual stop IDs you want to find journeys between.

## Sample GTFS Data
The `data/` directory contains sample GTFS data files (`stops.txt` and `routes.txt`) used for testing the program. You can replace these files with your own GTFS data files if needed.

## Implementation Details
- The program parses GTFS data to construct a graph representing the bus network, where stops are nodes and routes are edges connecting them.
- It uses graph traversal algorithms to find direct journeys and journeys with one transfer between the specified stops.

## Additional Notes
- This solution provides basic functionality for finding journeys with direct routes and one transfer. You can extend it to handle journeys with two transfers by implementing similar logic.
- The GTFS data used in this solution is simplified for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you may need to adapt the parsing logic to handle more complex data structures.
